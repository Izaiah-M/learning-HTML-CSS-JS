1
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:54,375
Your black cash, clean as a whistle.

2
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,791
Where is my treat?

3
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,458
On his way.

4
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,541
I don't like to wait.

5
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,458
Sometimes waiting is the best part.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,583
I hate the opera.

7
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,541
I'm wheels up for Moscow at intermission.

8
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,916
The deputy has his nuts in a twist
about Havana.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,208
He's threatening to send Guryev down here.

10
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,583
Don't worry.

11
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,583
You're late. He's in a mood.

12
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,583
He's always in a mood.

13
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,833
What's wrong?

14
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,125
I'm not supposed to say.

15
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,625
The council is meeting about you.

16
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,083
Do you know why?

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,666
I'm sure I can smooth it over.

18
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,375
How do I look?

19
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,291
Yes.

20
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,291
Go away.

21
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,708
End of the road, Max.

22
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,833
-You've been paid extra to make it hurt.
-No. That part's for free.
